# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset

[https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/notebook/zAgPl/logistic-regression-with-a-neural-network-mindset](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/notebook/zAgPl/logistic-regression-with-a-neural-network-mindset)


In this [notebook](./Logistic_Regression_with_a_Neural_Network_mindset.ipynb) you will build your first image recognition algorithm. You will build a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy! 

As you keep learning new techniques you will increase it to 80+ % accuracy on cat vs. non-cat datasets. By completing this assignment you will:

- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.
- Learn how to minimize the cost function.
- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.
