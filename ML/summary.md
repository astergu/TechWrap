The term "deep learning" was coined in 2006, and refers to machine learning algorithms that have *multiple non-linear layers* and can learn *feature hierarchies*.

Deep learning algorithms can be categorized by their architecture (feed-forward, feed-back, or bi-directional) and training protocols (purely supervised, hybrid, or unsupervised)
