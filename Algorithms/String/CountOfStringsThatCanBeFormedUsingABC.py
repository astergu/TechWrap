Given a length n, count the number of strings of length n that can be made using ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’ with at-most one ‘b’ and two ‘c’s allowed.

Input:

    The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the length of the string.


Output:

    Output the count of the strings that can be formed under the given constraint.

Constraints:

    1<= T <=100
    1<= N <=1000
