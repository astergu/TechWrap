/*
 * A palindrome is Ð° word or a phrase or a number, that when reversed, stays the same.

For example, the following sequences are palindromes : "azobi4amma4iboza" or "anna".

But this time, we are not interested in words but numbers. A "number palindrome" is a number, that taken backwards, remains the same.

For example, the numbers 1, 4224, 9999, 1221 are number palindromes.

Implement a function, which given an integer computes if it's a palindrome.
Input

One integer n, where 0 < n <= 10,000,000,000.
Output

Your function must return a boolean true if n is a palindrome and false otherwise.
