面试准备样例（全职工作）

# Time Arrangement

预计能提供中午1个小时，晚上2个小时，即每天共3个小时，每周（加周末）共21个小时的时间。按照一个月时间去准备的话，共有84个小时的时间准备。

## 需要覆盖的topics
1. Coding
2. System design / ML system design
3. Language specific concepts
4. Previous projects
5. Company specific reading
6. Leadership (non-tech)

## Coding Prep Plan
1. Complete arrays and strings EASY (5 days) to gain some confidence.
2. Everyday do 1 medium of arrays OR strings along with 1 easy of linked list or backtracking.
3. Do trees easy and graphs.
4. Do sorting & searching.
5. Do other remaining questions.


## Tips
1. Always think of the worst case scenario.

Goal
- Easy: 10mins
- Medium: 30mins
- Hard: 1hr

# Prep Tracking

- **Start**: 269/ 1159
- **Easy**: 113
- **Medium**: 136
- **Hard**: 20

## Day 1 (Aug 17 - Aug 18)

[**Array**] Easy +2: 922, 1086

### CLRS chap 1-5 
#### Sorting

- **Insertion Sort**: [python](../Algorithms/Sorting/InsertionSort.py)

#### Leetcode problems

- 922. Sort Array By Parity II (*Easy*) [python](./Problems/Leetcode/901-1000/922_SortArrayByParityII.py)

### What have learnt

## Day 2

[**Array**] Easy: 1122, 

#### Sorting

- **Merge Sort** [python](../Algorithms/Sorting/MergeSort.py)

#### Leetcode problems

- 1122. Relative Sort Array
- 1030. Matrix Cells in Distance Order

## Day 3

- **CLRS**
  - Let *A[1..n]* be an array of *n* distinct numbers. If *i* < *j* and *A[i]* > *A[j]*, then the pair (i, j) is called an **inversion** of A.
    - List the five inversions of the array [2, 3, 8, 6, 1].
    - What array with elements from the set {1, 2, ..., n} has the most inversions? How many does it have?
    - What is the relationship between the running time of insertion sort and the number of inversions in the input array?
    - Give an algorithm that determines the number of inversions in any permutation on *n* elements in O(nlgn) worst-case time. (Hint: Modify merge sort.)

System design
1. If you were to build a social networking website from scratch, how would you design the system?

## Day *

Could you tell me a little bit about the project you are most proud of?
