## Search
### Content Search

**Goal**

People use **content search** to find trillion pieces of shared content, such as posts, photos,
videos, and links. Thus they develop ML/ranking algorithms that are a three way optimization between
the query, searcher and context.

Deep Learning, GBDT, Ranking, Recommendation Algorithms, NLP/Context Understanding

### Search System

**Goal**

It starts with Typeahead/Autocomplete, passes through NLP service for query understanding and query
rewriting (including spell correction), and ends with Whole Page Ranking to order and display the 
final results. Search System uses a wide variety of ranking algorithms, NLP, and entity linking to 
understand a searcher's intent and provide the most relevant results possible.
