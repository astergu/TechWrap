## General Interview Tips

### Explain

**Explain your thought process** and decision making throughout the interview. Explicitly **state and check assumptions** with your interviewer to ensure they are reasonable.

### Clarify

Look to see how you engage with the problem and your primary method for solving it. Be sure to **talk through your thought process** and feel free to **ask specific questions** if you need clarification.

### Improve

Think about ways to **improve the solution** you present it. It's worthwhile to think out loud about your initial thoughts to a question.  If necessary, start with the brute force solution and improve on it.

### Practice

**Practice writing code on paper or a whiteboard**. Be sure to **test your code** and ensure it's easily **readable without bugs**.


## The Coding & Algorithm Interviews

### Coding

Preferably C++, Java, Python, Go, or C. You will be expected to know APIs, Object Oriented Design and Programming, how to test your code, as well as come up with corner cases and edge cases for code. 

### Algorithms

Approach the problem with both bottom-up and top-down algorithms. You will be expected to know the complexity of an algorithm and how you can improve/change it. 

**Sorting (plus searching and binary search), divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming/memoization, greediness, recursion or algorithms linked to a specific data structure. Knowledge Big-O notations (e.g. run time and be ready to discuss complex algorithms like Dijkstra and A*. Recommend discussing or outlining the algorithm you have in mind before writing code.**


- **Sorting**: be familiar with common sorting functions and on what kind of input data they're efficient on or not. 
- **Data Structures**: Data structures most frequently used are **arrays**, **linked lists**, **stacks**, **queues**, **hash-sets**, **hash-maps**, **hash-tables**, **dictionary**, **trees**,  and **binary trees**, **heaps** and **graphs**. You should know the data structure inside out, and what algorithms tend to go along with each data structure.
- **Mathematics**: Counting problems, probability problems and other Discrete Math 101 situations. **Probability theory** and **Combinatorics**. You should be familiar with **n-choose-k** problems.
- **Graphs**: consider if a problem can be applied with graph algorithms like **distance**, **search**, **connectivity**, **cycle-detection**, etc. You should know the basic **graph traversal** algorithms, **breadth-first search** and **depth-first search**. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs and how to implement them in real code. 
- **Recursion**: Use recursion to find more elegant solutions to problems that can be solved iteratively.
