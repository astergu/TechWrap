A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes. In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the linked list. A doubly linked list gives each node pointers to both the next node and the previous node.

The benefit of a linked list is that you can add and remove items from the beginning of the list in constant time. 

## Creating a Linked List

The java code below implements a very basic singly linked list.

```java
class Node {
    Node next = null;
    int data;

    public Node(int d) {
        data = d;
    }

    void appendToTail(int d) {
        Node end = new Node(d);
        Node n = this;
        while (n.next != null) {
            n = n.next;
        }
        n.next = end;
    }
}
```
