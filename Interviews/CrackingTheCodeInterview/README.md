# The Interview Process

Interviewer will make an assessment of your performance, usually based on the following:

- **Analytical skills**: Did you need much help solving the problem? How optimal was your solution? How long did it take you to arrive at a solution? If you had to design/architect a new solution, did you structure the problem well and think through the tradeoffs of different decisions?
- **Coding skills**: Were you able to successfully translate your algorithm to reasonable code? Was it clean and well-organized? Did you think
about potential errors? Did you use good style?
- **Technical knowledge / Computer Science fundamentals**: Do you have a strong foundation in computer science and the relevant technologies?
- **Experience**: Have you made good technical decisions in the past? Have you built interesting, challenging projects? Have you shown drive, initiative, and other important factors?
- **Culture fit / Communication skills**: Do your personality and values fit with the company and team? Did you communicate well with your interviewer?

# Behind the scenes

## The Microsoft Interview

### Things-to-do

- A short interview with a recruiter who will give you a sample question.
- Four or five interviews, often with two different teams.
- When you complete your interviews with a team, you might speak with a hiring manager, which is a great sign.
- You might get a decision that day, or it might be a week.

### Definitely Prepare
- "Why do you want to work for Microsoft?"

## The Amazon Interview

### Things-to-do

- Typically begins with a phone screen in which a candidate interviews with a specific team. 
- Four or five interviews with one or two teams that have selected you. Interviewers are each assigned a specific area to probe and may seem very different from each other.
- The "bar raiser" interviewer is charged with keeping the interview bar high. If one interview seems significantly harder and different, that's most likely the bar raiser. This person has both significant experience with interviews and vote power in the hiring decision.

### Definitely Prepare

Amazon cares a lot about scale. Make sure you prepare for scalability questions. 

Additionally, Amazon tends to ask a lot of questions about object-oriented design. 

## The Google Interview

### Things-to-do

- A Google engineer performs the first phone screen, so expect tough technical questions. These questions may involve coding, sometimes via a shared document. Candidates are typically held to the same standard and are asked similar questions one phone screens as in on-site interview.
- On your on-site interview, you'll interview with four to six people, one of whom will be a lunch interviewer. Your lunch interviewer doesn't submit feedback, so this is a great opportunity to ask honest questions. 
- Interviewers are typically not given specific focuses, and there is no "structure" or "system" as to what you're asked. Each interviewer can conduct the interview however she/he would like.
- Written feedback is submitted to a hiring committee (HC) of engineers and managers to make a hire/no-hire recommendation. Feedback is typically broken down into four categories (*Analyical Ability*, *Coding*, *Experience*, and *Communication*) and you are given an overall score from 1.0 to 4.0. To extend an offer, the HC wants to see at least one interviewer who is an "enthusiastic endorser". In other words, a packet with scores of 3.6, 3.1, 3.1 and 2.6 is better than all 3.1s.

### Definitely Prepare

As a web-based company, Google cares about how to design a scalable system.

## The Apple Interview

### Things-to-do

- Begins with a recruiter screen to get a basic sense of your skills.
- Onsite interview: you'll typically be greeted by the recruiter who provides an overview of the process. You will then have 6-8 interviews with members of the team with which you're interviewing. 

### Definitely Prepare

## The Facebook Interview

### Things-to-do

- Once selected for an interview, candidates will generally do one or two phone screens.
- After the phone interview(s), you might be asked to do a homework assignment that will include a mix of coding and algorithms. Pay attention to your coding style here. 
- During your on-site interview, you will interview primarily with other software engineers, but hiring managers are also involved whenever they are available. 
- Each interviewer is given a "role" during the on-site interviews, these roles are:
    - *Behavioral ("Jedi")*: This interview assesses your ability to be successful in Facebook's environment.
    - *Coding and Algorithms ("Ninja")*: These are your standard coding and algorithms questions.
    - *Design/Architecture (Pirate)*: For a backend software engineer, You might be asked system design questions. Front-end or other specialities will be asked design questions related to that discipline. You should openly discuss different solutions and their tradeoffs. 

You can typically expect two "ninja" interviews and one "jedi" interview. Experienced candidates will also usually get a "pirate" interview.

Once every interviewer's feedback is submitted, your interviewing team and hiring manager get together to collaborate on a final decision. 

### Definitely Prepare

Facebook wants developers with an entrepreneurial spirit. In your interviews, you should show that you love to build stuff fast.

They want to know you can hack together an elegant and scalable solution using any language of choice. 

## The Palantir Interview

Unlike some companies which do "pooled" interviews, Palantir interviews for a specific team. Occasionally, your application might be re-routed to another team where there is a better fit.

- Typically starts with two phone interviews. Expect to cover a bit about your prior experience, with a heavy focus on algorithm questions.
- Onsite interview with up to five people Onsite interviews cover your prior experience, relevant domain knowledge, data structures and algorithms, and design. 
- After the interview, the interviews meet to discuss your feedback with the hiring manager. 

### Definitely Prepare

Many candidates report that Palantir's questions were harder than those they saw at Google and other top companies. If you're interviewing with Palantir, you should learn your core data structures and algorithms inside and out. 

Brush up on system design too if you're interviewing for a backend role.
