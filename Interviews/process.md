Ask questions about:

1. A brief introduction to what you are currently working on.
2. Why do you consider looking for job opportunities?
3. When will you consider moving to a new job?
4. What work status are you currently holding? Do you need work sponsorship?
5. What do you value the most for this company's offer?
6. What programming language are you most familiar with?

### Goal 
- Decide if you fit the job requirement
- Get a basic idea of your skill set and seniority to try to understand what positions you might qualify and be interested in.

### Key points
- Past experience
- Interests
- Motivation
- Skills
- Why you fit this role 


## Phone Screen

Usually conducted by an engineer.

- Talk about himself/herself (name, team, designation, years of experience) **\[2mins\]**
- Self introduction **\[1min\]**
- Code 
    - an easy "warm-up" question (should solve it in 5min), e.g. "reverse a string", "implement atoi"
    - a "real" question (barely finish it in the remaining 35min), e.g.
        - remove duplicates from a list of strings which is larger than the available memory (i.e. with reloads from disk)
        - count the number of disjoint objects in a bitmap
        - implement a program which plays tic-tac-toe

## Programming Interviews Exposed

### Phone Screen

- How do you allocate memory in C?
- Why is recursion bad?
- How iis programming for a mobile device different from programmiing for a normal computer?
- **FizzBuzz**: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, if a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" inistead of the number, and if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
- **Reverse a string**: Write a function that reverses a string without using any library functions.
- **Removing duplicates**: Given an unsorted list of integers, write a function that returns a new list with all duplicate values removed.
